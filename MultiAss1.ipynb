    "Q1.what is multithreading in python?why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python\n",
    "\n",
    " Multithreading in Python refers to a programming concept where multiple threads of execution run concurrently within a single process. \n",
    "  Each thread is a separate path of execution that can perform tasks independently of the other threads.\n",
    "\n",
    " Multithreading is used in Python to improve the performance of programs by taking advantage of modern processors, which often have multiple cores\n",
    "   that can execute multiple threads at the same time. By using multithreading, it is possible to perform several tasks simultaneously and\n",
    "  achieve better program efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    " The \"threading\" module is used in Python to handle threads. This module provides several classes and functions that can be used to create and\n",
    "  manage threads in Python programs. The \"Thread\" class, which is part of the threading module, is used to create new threads, and the \"Lock\" class\n",
    " is used to synchronize access to shared resources between threads."

    "Multithreading is a programming technique that involves running multiple threads of execution within a single program. Here are some advantages and \n",
    "disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Increased performance: Multithreading can improve the performance of certain types of programs by allowing multiple tasks to run concurrently. \n",
    "This can be especially useful for programs that perform I/O-bound operations, such as file or network access, as other threads can continue to\n",
    "execute while waiting for I/O operations to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Improved responsiveness: By separating a program's tasks into multiple threads, the user interface can remain responsive even if one thread is\n",
    "busy performing a time-consuming task.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Better resource utilization: Multithreading can help maximize the use of available system resources by allowing multiple tasks to execute\n",
    "  simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Simplified code: In some cases, multithreading can simplify code by breaking a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts that \n",
    "can be executed independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Complexity: Multithreading can add complexity to a program, making it more difficult to understand and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Synchronization issues: When multiple threads access shared resources, synchronization issues can arise. These issues can lead to bugs\n",
    "   that are difficult to detect and fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Overhead: Creating and managing threads can involve overhead, such as additional memory and CPU usage, which can impact performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Debugging difficulties: Debugging multithreaded code can be more challenging than debugging single-threaded code, as issues can occur in \n",
    " non-deterministic ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, multithreading can be a powerful tool for improving performance and responsiveness in certain types of programs, but it also requires \n",

    "Q6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Deadlocks and race conditions are two common issues that can occur when using multithreading.\n",

    "Deadlocks: A deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked waiting for each other to release resources that they need in \n",
    "order to proceed. For example, Thread 1 may hold a lock on Resource A and be waiting for Resource B, while Thread 2 may hold a lock on Resource\n",
    "B and be waiting for Resource A. Neither thread can proceed until the other releases its lock, resulting in a deadlock. Deadlocks can be difficult \n",
    "to detect and resolve, and can cause a program to become unresponsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race conditions: A race condition occurs when two or more threads access a shared resource in a way that leads to unexpected behavior. For example, \n",
    "if two threads are trying to increment the same variable at the same time, the value of the variable may not be what is expected due to the \n",
    "non-deterministic order in which the threads execute. Race conditions can lead to bugs that are difficult to detect and reproduce, and can cause a \n",
    "program to behave in unexpected ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent deadlocks, it is important to avoid circular waits, which occur when a thread is waiting for a resource that is held by another\n",
    "thread that is, in turn, waiting for a resource that is held by the first thread. To prevent race conditions, it is important to use synchronization \n",
    "mechanisms, such as locks or semaphores, to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time. Synchronization mechanisms can also\n",
